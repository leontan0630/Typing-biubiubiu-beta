Among the sights of London Town
 Which little visitors wish to view,
 The Tower stands first, and its great renown
 Has, you will notice, attracted Prue.

 At a well-known spot, to Miss Prue's surprise,
 Some fine old ravens are strutting about.
 If upon the picture a glance you cast,
 You will know the ravens next time, no doubt.

 The red-coated guard who's watching here
 Is called a Beefeater--fancy that!
 And Prue discovers, as she draws near,
 A child by his side who is round and fat.

 "Father and Mother, pray come here,"
 In tones so pleasant, laughs lively Prue:
 "You've shown _me_ things that are odd and queer,
 A Beefeater's baby I'll show _you_!"
