Prue has wandered high and wandered low
 Through Norman chapel and dungeon cell;
 The grand Crown Jewels that sparkle so,
 And the Traitor's Gate, she has seen as well.

 She has looked from the walls on the River, too,
 And spent in the Armouries nearly an hour:
 Ah! holiday folks like our Miss Prue
 Enjoy themselves when they come to the Tower!

 But the Tower was a prison, in days of old,
 And few who got into it ever came out,
 Though now we can visit the grim stronghold
 Any day of the week, without fear or doubt.
