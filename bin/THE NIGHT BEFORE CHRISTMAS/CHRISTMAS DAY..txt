Boys, said Mrs Howard one morning, looking up from a letter she was
 reading, I have had a letter from your grandmamma. She writes that
 she is returning to England shortly.
 The boys went on with their breakfast without showing any great amount
 of interest in this piece of news, for they had never seen their
 grandmother, and therefore could not very well be expected to show any
 affection for her.
 Now Mrs Howard, the mother of two of the boys and aunt to the third
 little fellow, was a widow and very poor, and often found it a hard
 task to provide for her three boys, as she called them, for, having
 adopted her little orphan nephew, she always treated him as her own
 son. She had sometimes thought it strange that old Mrs Howard should
 not have offered to provide for Leslie herself but she had never done
 so, and at last Mrs Howard had ceased to expect it. But now, right at
 the end of her letter, Grandmamma Howard wrote:--
 I have been thinking that perhaps it would come a little hard on you
 to support not only your own two boys, but poor Alice's son, and so,
 on my return to England, I propose, if you are willing, to adopt one
 of them, for I am a lonely old woman and shall be glad of a young face
 about me again.
 After thinking the matter over, Mrs Howard decided she would say
 nothing about their grandmother's intention to the boys, as she
 thought that it was just possible she might change her mind again.
 Time passed on, and winter set in, and full of the delights of
 skating, the boys forgot all about the expected arrival of their
 grandmother.

 During the Christmas holidays the boys one morning started off to
 Broome Meadow for a good day's skating on the pond there. They carried
 their dinner with them, and were told to be sure and be home before
 dark.

 As they ran along the frosty road they came suddenly upon a poor old
 woman, so suddenly that Leslie ran right up against her before he
 could stop himself. The old woman grumbled about lazy, selfish boys,
 only thinking of their own pleasure, and not caring what happened to a
 poor old woman!

 But Leslie stopped at once and apologized, in his polite little way,
 for his carelessness.

 I _am_ sorry, he said. I hope I did not hurt you; and you have such
 heavy parcels to carry too. Won't you let me help you?

 Oh! come on, Leslie, said his cousins; we shall never get to the
 pond at this rate!

 Yes, go on, said the old woman sharply; your skating is of a great
 deal more importance than an old woman, eh?

 But Leslie's only answer was to take the parcels and trudge merrily
 along beside his companion.

 On the way to her cottage the old woman asked him all sorts of
 questions about himself and his cousins, and then, having reached her
 cottage, dismissed him with scarcely a thank you for the trouble he
 had taken. But Leslie did not take it much to heart.

 He raced along, trying his hardest to overtake his cousins before they
 reached the pond, and was soon skimming about with the rest of them.

 Squire Leaholme, in whose grounds the boys were skating, afterwards
 came down to the pond to watch the fun, and, being a kind-hearted old
 gentleman, offered to give a prize of a new pair of skates to the boy
 who should win the greatest number of races.

 As it was getting late, it was arranged that the racing should come
 off on the following day, and the Squire invited all the boys who took
 part in it, to come up to his house to a substantial tea, after the
 fun was over.

 How delighted Leslie was, for he was a first-rate skater, and he _did_
 so want a new pair of skates!

 But the Squire's skates were not to be won by him, for on the
 following day as he and his cousins were on their way to the pond,
 they came across the queer old woman whom they had met on the previous
 day.

 She was sitting on the ground, and seemed to be in great pain. The
 boys stopped to ask what ailed her, and she told them that she had
 slipped and twisted her foot, and was afraid that her ankle was
 sprained, for she could not bear to put it to the ground.

 You musn't sit here in the cold, said Leslie; come, try and get up,
 and I will help you home.

 Oh! Leslie, cried both his cousins, don't go. You will be late for
 the races, and lose your chance of the prize.

 Poor Leslie! He turned first red, then white, and then said, in a
 husky tone of voice--

 Never mind--you go on without me.

 You're a good laddie, said the old woman. Will you be _very_ sorry
 to miss the fun?

 Leslie muttered something about not minding _much_, and then the brave
 little fellow set himself to help the poor old woman home, as gently
 and tenderly as he could.

 She would not let him come in with her, but told him to run off as
 quickly as he could, and perhaps after all, he would not be too late
 for the skating. But Leslie could not bear to leave her alone and in
 pain, so he decided to run home and fetch his Aunt.

 When Mrs Howard arrived at the cottage, you can think how surprised
 she was to find that Leslie's poor old woman was none other than
 Grandmamma Howard herself, who wishing to find out the real characters
 of her grandsons, had chosen to come in this disguise to the little
 village where they lived.

 You will easily guess which of the three boys Grandmamma chose to be
 her little companion. And oh! what a lovely Grandmamma she was, as not
 only Leslie, but his cousins too, found out. She always seemed to know
 exactly what a boy wanted, and still better, to give it to him.

 Walter and Stanley often felt terribly ashamed of the selfish manner
 in which they had behaved, and wished they were more like Leslie.

 But Grandmamma told them that it was never too late to mend, and
 they took her advice, and I am quite sure that at the present moment
 if they were to meet a poor old woman in distress by the roadside,
 they would not pass her by, as they once did Grandmamma Howard.
