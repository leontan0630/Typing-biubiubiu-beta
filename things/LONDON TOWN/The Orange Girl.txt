Orange girl Kitty
 Here you may see.
 That she is pretty
 All will agree.
 "Three for a penny!"
 That is her cry;
 No wonder many
 Hasten to buy.

 Orange girl Kitty's
 Mother, we're told,
 Everyone pities--
 So feeble and old.
 Poor mother's living
 Kitty obtains,
 Cheerfully giving
 Her all that she gains.

 Orange girl Kitty
 Roams to and fro;
 All through the city
 She's known high and low.
 When the sun's shining,
 When the rain falls,
 Never repining,--
 "Fine fruit!" Kitty calls.
